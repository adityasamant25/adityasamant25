## About me
With nearly two decades of experience in the software industry, I bring a wealth of
expertise to the table.  
In recent years, my primary focus has been on delving into microservices and
cloud-native technologies, with a particular emphasis on those revolving around [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg" width="20" height="20" />.

My background encompasses not only technical proficiency but also a strong track record in managerial roles. I am deeply committed to continuous learning and constantly honing my skills.

I [actively contribute](https://adityasamant-learnings.com/blog/1/kubernetes/kubernetes-contributions.html) to the [documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) for Kubernetes.

You can visit my personal portal [here](https://adityasamant.dev).

## My Interests
I love to play a part as a Kubernetes developer advocate. I spend a good amount of time on forums related to Kubernetes trying to resolve issues that users report.

I'm currently invested in improving my skills in Spring Boot & Istio.
As an effort towards it, I'm building my own Spring Boot projects and deploying them on my personal Istio playground.

Technologies I am passionate about include Kubernetes, Helm, Service Mesh (mainly Istio), AWS, Java, Spring, Spring Boot.
